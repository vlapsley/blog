## My PVR is bricked

So my PVR (Personal Video Recorder) is bricked. It powers on but won't start the bootloader process as per this [discussion thread](http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=10287).

It's a Beyonwiz T3 and I've had it about three and a half years. It's been great. We use it recording some free to air TV, but mostly as a media player.

But I stumbled upon [this thread](http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=10830) with instructions on how to replace capacitors in the power supply.

## Where's my credit card?

Blam. Order placed. I've soldered before and it wasn't all bad. I grew up with Dick Smith electronics kits. Challenge accepted.

Parts $12, Delivery $15. Yeah, ok.

## Soldering iron time

Well, not quite yet. I'll post the results later. I'm still awaiting delivery of the capacitors, but hopefully later this week I can rave about my success.
