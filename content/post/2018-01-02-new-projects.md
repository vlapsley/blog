## Is this a New Year's resolutions list?

Nope. I don't do resolutions. I do projects. This year I've got two projects in mind with clear outcomes. The first is to **really** learn programming. The second is to build a RetroPie gaming console with a Raspberry Pi and arcade-style joysticks.

## Learn to program, again again

I can recall at least five times in my life I've tried to learn programming, made some progress and then stopped learning. Why I've stopped boils down to a few things but it's usually a combination of not finding activities/projects that continue programming or dedicating enough time to practice the concepts. Programming is one of those things that requires continued practice.

With my ambitions to "do the DevOps" instead of just Ops, I really need to up my Dev game.

So my first project for the year is to learn to program. I've settled on Python as the language of choice. I already have a few books but to keep myself really going I thought I'd get myself a few Raspberry Pis to hack some DIY projects.

### How will I track progress?

I've signed up to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) which has a 30-day code tutorial. I aim to complete one-hundred practice challenges for the year, which if you take out the 30-day turotial and a 6-week vacation to the USA later this year, averages out to about three-per-week.

## 2018 Year of the Pi

I love a bit of DIY and I've always enjoyed computer games. This year I aim to build a RetroPie gaming station with arcade-style joysticks and a Raspberry Pi. I've got a [bartop arcade cabinet](https://youtu.be/lAMmIcVIh3o) in mind, two-player because I have two daughters.

Based on the success of the gaming console, I may add some more Raspberry Pi projects further down the line. I'm interested in a DIY weather station. Or maybe something with a robot for the kids to play with and learn some basic coding.
