## A slight change of plan

In my [previous post](/post/where-is-my-soldering-iron/), I mentioned an ambitious plan to replace some capacitors in a faulty power supply for my PVR (Personal Video Recorder). The capacitors arrived the day after ordering - excellent service from [element14](http://au.element14.com/).

But after going through the Beyonwiz forums further, I found that some users had replaced one faulty capacitor and got their PVR up and running again. Advice suggested replacing more capacitors to prevent further failure, but I have spares now and I wasn't overly confident on my soldering skills. It has been a long, long time.

## The operation was a success

Broke out the soldering iron and removed the faulty capacitor. You can see by the brown colouring on top and slight bulging that it is indeed faulty.

I then soldered in the new capacitor. I can't tell you how good my soldering was. It was like back being a kid in the 1980s with [Dick Smith Fun Way kits](https://www.google.com.au/search?tbm=isch&as_q=dick+smith+electronics+kits+fun+way).

I gave the unit a clean, screwed it back together and plugged it back in.

## It lives

Not only was the operation a success, the patient survived too. The word "Booting..." appeared on the LCD display and I knew I had triumphed.

Little Audrey summed it up best: "Good job Daddy!" So flippin' proud of myself. DIY done right is very satisfying.
