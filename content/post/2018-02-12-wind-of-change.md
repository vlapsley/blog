## Out with Ops. In with DevOps.

This week is the start of a big change. I handed in my resignation to `$current_employer`.

![alt text][1]

Beginning on March 13, I will be a **DevOps Engineer**! I was sounded out by [CircuIT](http://circuitrecruitment.com.au/), a recruiting firm, and after a lengthy interview process through January, I got the role.

I will be working for a medical devices, intruments and research company that develops and supplies clinical diagnostics to the pathology market.

In a growing DevOps team, I will be looking after a predominantly Windows and .NET shop. I will PowerShell all the things!

## You make your own luck

So, literally two months after creating a blog stating my ambitions to transition from Ops to DevOps, I land a DevOps job. I'm not sure if this tiny corner of the Internet had any influence, but it can't have hurt.

## Programming update

I've been doing the 30 Days of Code in Python from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). See my [GitHub](https://github.com/vlapsley/30-days-of-code) repo for where I am up to. I've completed the first 12 days of challenges, but hit some time/priority issues and haven't made any progress for almost three weeks :(

I'm hoping to get back into it soon and then repeat the same challenges, but this time with PowerShell.

## Agile training

A couple of weeks ago I completed a two-day training course with `$current_employer` on Agile fundamentals. Whilst I already knew the concepts of Agile delivery, I found the course invaluable in practicing the concepts with colleagues using Kanban and sprints. I'm in with Agile!
