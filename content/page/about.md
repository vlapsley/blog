## Nerd. Droid. @Work.

![Did You Know That Wasn't Me?][1]

Hello. I am a Computer Operations droid, model VL-24. I am also known as Vaughan.

Vaughan resides in Melbourne, Australia. It is quite habitable, although some locals are somewhat [dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_snake "Ssssss!").

### VL-24

The VL-24 Computer Operations droid is proficient in operating systems, Windows, MacOS and CentOS/Ubuntu. VL-24 specializes in cloud technologies, email, firewall and PowerShell automation. Perhaps the VL-24 can assist you on your next build of the [Death Star](http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star "You may fire when ready.").

### Why?

This blog is Vaughan's journey exploring [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops "Keep CALM"). Expect how-tos, procedural knowledge, tutorials, you know... RTFM material.

Other topics may [creep](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creeper "That's a very nice everything you have there... it'd be a shame if something happened to it.") in.

### Droids?

Droids are awesome. The VL-24 has built two small droids to assist with downtime - the IL-8 'Isabella' and AL-4 'Audrey'. They are very chatty and entertaining, but do require regular programming and maintenance.
